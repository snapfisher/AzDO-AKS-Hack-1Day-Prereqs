# Intro To Azure DevOps Pipelines & AKS Hack -- 1 Day Version

Note that this repo contains only the Challenge 0 Prework instructions.  Version 20-Apr-2021.

## Introduction
This intro level hack will help you get hands-on experience with Docker, Kubernetes and the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) on Microsoft Azure, as well as creating Azure DevOps Pipeline for use in deploying containerized code to AKS. Kubernetes has quickly gone from being the shiny new kid on the block to the defacto way to deploy and orchestrate containerized applications.

Being a one day event, this hack will focus on the use of AKS and the creation of Azure DevOps pipelines.  There is a tremendous amount of additional information which you will need to become proficient with each tool.  Specifically, we are not going to dwell much on how to containerize application.  Nor are we going to spend time on the other pieces of functionality within Azure DevOps, including Azure Boards, the creation and management of PRs, and many, many more topics.  At one point in the exercise, we will use Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes, but we will not really get into it's use.  It is recommended to examine if Helm will suit your needs outside of this hack.

## Learning Objectives
In this hack you will solve a common challenge for companies migrating to the cloud. You will take a simple multi-tiered web app, containerize it, and deploy it to an AKS cluster. Once the application is in AKS, you will learn how scale it and then use Azure DevOps Pipelines to deploy the code.  We will also take a look at Private AKS Clusters, where all of the cluster is protected from the internet.
